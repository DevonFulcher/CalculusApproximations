# CalculusApproximations
A few algorithms to calculate calculus concepts using SymPy. Euler's method, approximating alternating series, Simpson's rule

pip install sympy

## Euler's Method
Approximates the y value of a differential equation at a x value given a y value at a separate x.

## Approximate Alternating Series
Approximates the value of a convergent alternating series to an arbitrary precision.

## Simpson's Rule
Approximates the value of a definite integral.
